A simple, fully functional calculator created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  Still a work in progress.

CURRENT FEATURES: 

-Takes input and is able to do arithmetic, also accepts chaining operations 

-Accepts keyboard input for digits (operators are broken)

-Currently rounds numbers to two decimal places

TO ADD:

-Backspace button

-Two displays (top display shows operands and operator, bottom display shows result of operations)


BUGS TO FIX:

-Keyboard input for operators (+, *, /, -, =) and "." is broken

-For some reason it's impossible to start inputting through the keyboard before clicking at least one button with the mouse

-Cannot enter two numbers that are less than one (i.e .56 and .87) in a row.  Likely due to how the inputDecimal() function works
